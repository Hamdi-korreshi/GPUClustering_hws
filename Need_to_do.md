# Hybrid MPI+CUDA Lesson Plan

## Module 1: MPI Fundamentals

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Understand MPI environment basics (initialization, finalization, process rank, and size).
- Master basic MPI communication routines: point-to-point (MPI_Send/MPI_Recv) and collective operations (MPI_Bcast, MPI_Scatter, MPI_Gather, MPI_Reduce).

**Recommended Exercises:**
1. **Hello World MPI:**  
   Write a program where each MPI process prints a "Hello from rank X" message.
2. **Data Distribution:**  
   Implement a program that uses `MPI_Scatter` to distribute segments of an array to each process and `MPI_Gather` to collect results.
3. **Parallel Reduction:**  
   Write a program to compute the sum of an array distributed over multiple processes using `MPI_Reduce`.

## Module 2: CUDA Fundamentals

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Understand the CUDA programming model: threads, blocks, and grids.
- Learn device memory allocation, data transfers between host and device, and kernel launching.
- Write simple CUDA kernels and understand execution configuration.

**Recommended Exercises:**
1. **Vector Addition:**  
   Create a CUDA program that performs vector addition.
2. **Dot Product:**  
   Implement a CUDA kernel to compute the dot product of two vectors.
3. **Simple Reduction:**  
   Develop a CUDA kernel that sums the elements of an array using a basic reduction technique.

## Module 3: Advanced CUDA Topics

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Use shared memory for fast data access and understand thread synchronization with `__syncthreads()`.
- Learn about optimizing memory access patterns and avoiding bank conflicts.
- Debug and profile CUDA applications using NVIDIA tools.

**Recommended Exercises:**
1. **Matrix Multiplication:**  
   Write a CUDA program to multiply two matrices using shared memory.
2. **Parallel Reduction (Binary Tree):**  
   Develop a CUDA kernel that performs binary tree reduction to sum an array.
3. **Performance Profiling:**  
   Use the NVIDIA Visual Profiler (or NSight) to analyze and optimize a CUDA program.

## Module 4: Hybrid MPI+CUDA Programming

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Combine MPI and CUDA: distribute work across nodes and use each node’s GPU for local computations.
- Integrate results from multiple MPI processes to form a final output.
- Understand the challenges of data partitioning and synchronization in hybrid applications.

**Recommended Exercises:**
1. **Hybrid Dot Product:**  
   Write a program that uses `MPI_Scatter` to distribute portions of two vectors to multiple processes, each process computes a dot product on its GPU (using CUDA), and `MPI_Gather` or `MPI_Reduce` is used to sum the partial results.
2. **Hybrid Reduction:**  
   Create an application that distributes an array among MPI processes, each performing a parallel reduction on its GPU, and then combines the partial sums using `MPI_Reduce`.
3. **Hybrid Matrix Multiplication (Advanced):**  
   Implement a matrix multiplication program where the workload is distributed via MPI and each process performs its part on the GPU.

## Module 5: Debugging and Optimization

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Gain proficiency in debugging MPI programs (e.g., using logging and error codes) and CUDA kernels (using `cuda-memcheck` or NSight).
- Understand performance bottlenecks in distributed GPU applications.
- Learn strategies for optimizing both MPI communications and CUDA kernel performance.

**Recommended Exercises:**
1. **CUDA Debugging:**  
   Run a CUDA program through `cuda-memcheck` to identify and fix memory issues.
2. **MPI Debugging:**  
   Use simple logging and error-checking in MPI routines to troubleshoot communication problems.
3. **Performance Tuning:**  
   Experiment with different block sizes, grid dimensions, and MPI process counts on a hybrid dot product application to identify performance improvements.
